Compiling/Installing From Source
================================

Prerequisites
-------------

Below is a list of OS's and the libraries that you (might) need to
install (including their respective development libraries):

- libpng
- libtiff
- libpng

The Process
-----------

NB - There is no configure step, so just do the following:

* make

To install hide you (currently) need to compile it, and then manually
move the binaries to wherever you want them (there is no make install,
yet).
