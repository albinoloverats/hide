hide
====

Warning: hide is currently in the alpha stages of development!

hide is a steganographic tool for hiding data in images. Currently this
is all it does. It (currently) supports JPEG, PNG, TIFF and Webp images,
through might support other image formats in the future.

A list of things the hide isn't:

 * An encryption tool
 * A compression tool

If you need either of these things doing (which you ideally should -
let's not have just one layer of security but many complimentary layers)
then checkout encrypt as it does both of those things.
