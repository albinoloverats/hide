hide
====

hide is a steganographic tool for hiding data in images. Currently this
is all it does. It supports PNG, TIFF and Webp images (so far) and might
support other (lossless) image formats in the future.

A list of things the hide isn't:

 * An encryption tool
 * A compression tool

If you need either of these things doing (which you ideally should -
let's not have just one layer of security but many complimentary layers)
then checkout encrypt.
