About
-----

Warning: hide is currently in the beta stages of development!

hide is a steganographic tool for hiding data in, and retrieving data
from, images; this is all it does. It (currently) supports BMP, JPEG,
PNG, TIFF and Webp images, though might support other image formats in
the future.

A list of things the hide isn't:

 * An encryption tool
 * A compression tool

If you need either of these things doing (which you really should -
don't use just one layer of security but many complimentary layers)
then checkout [encrypt][] as it does both of those things.

Usage
-----

There are three possible usages of hide:

    hide <image> <document> <output>
    hide <image> <output>
    hide <image>

The first will hide the document in the first image and produce an
output image which contains the hidden data. The second will retrieve,
and place into the output file, a previously hidden file. And finally,
the third will show the images capacity for hiding a file in the given
image.

You can also use the script:

./truly-hide <image> [file]

This will first encrypt the file (using encrypt, of course) and then
hide it. Using this script there is no metadata leakage about what may,
or may not, be hidden in a particular image, as it uses the advanced
functionality of encrypt of not creating a recognizable container. Omit
[file] to recover a previously encrypted and hidden file (it will be
extracted to the current directory).

Known Issues
------------

* Debian/Slackware
  - WebP library doesn't compile
    - Missing definition for lossless image encoding (Debian)
    - Missing entire header for encoding (Slackware)
