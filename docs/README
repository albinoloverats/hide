About
-----

Warning: hide is currently in the beta stages of development!

hide is a steganographic tool for hiding data in, and retrieving data
from, images; this is all it does. It (currently) supports JPEG, PNG,
TIFF and Webp images, though might support other image formats in the
future.

A list of things the hide isn't:

 * An encryption tool
 * A compression tool

If you need either of these things doing (which you really should -
don't use just one layer of security but many complimentary layers)
then checkout encrypt as it does both of those things.

Usage
-----

There are three possible usages of hide:

    hide <image> <document> <output>
    hide <image> <output>
    hide <image>

The first will hide the document in the first image and produce an
output image which contains the hidden data. The second will retrieve,
and place into the output file, a previously hidden file. And finally,
the third will show the images capacity for hiding a file.
